# üèó Account Abstraction | Smart Wallet | Entry Point contract 

This repository demonstrates the end to end account abstraction architecture. In this codebase, developers can deploy a entry point smart contract with wallet factories, smart wallet with modules support. These smart contracts are inspired from Biconomy and Gnosis safe smart contract accounts and account abstraction. 

Technical Stuff included in this codebase are
1. Entry point smart contract to facilitate the Account abstraction
2. Smart wallet (A smart contract based wallet)
3. Modules system to support plug-in/plug-out modules for our smart wallet
4. Create2 deterministic deployment with wallet proxy contract - Helpful to deploy a smart wallet in different chains with same address
